InternHub is a platform for Finding Internships for Students

Our application is called InternHub. The platform is designed to connect students and companies so that students can find internships. In the application, we expect all students who have extra free time, want to learn something new, prepare for their future careers, and gain experience in the job market to sign up. We also expect companies to register if they are looking for students eager to acquire new knowledge and experience by interning with them.

Three types of users:

STUDENT - input personal information and edit (name, surname, field of study), apply for internships with companies. Students can view all available internships and, by selecting a desired internship, go to a page with internship details where they can apply. They can filter internships by name, date, and county. Students can also view all the internships they have applied to and see the status of their applications on the "Applied" page. All lists have paging options. Students can edit their profile information.

ADMIN - has privileges to decide which companies can post internships and whether to accept a company into the system. Companies must be valid and legitimate. The admin also has the right to edit companies and students details.

COMPANY - When a user (company representative) registers for the first time, they must wait for approval from the administrator to be accepted into the system. As a company, the user can create internship posts (title, description, duration). After creating them, the home page will display all created internships, and the company can edit them and see the number of students who have applied for each internship. By clicking on the "Review" button, the company can accept or reject a student for the internship.

Upon entering the website, users can log in as a company, student, or administrator. Depending on the type of account they log in with, the application will display accordingly.

All communication between users will take place through email services. When a student applies for an internship, the company receives an email notification. The company can then accept or reject the student within the application or send an email with further instructions and questions.
